apt
===

* update - updates the list of packages but do not install

* upgrade - install new versions of packages if new versions are available

* full-upgrade - performs the function of upgrade but will remove currently installed packages 
  if this is needed to upgrade the system as a whole (fixing bad dependencies then)

* autoremove, autoclean and clean - clean old packages which are not needed any more

* option -y does not request for permission on every step
  && states that it just runs the next command if the previous was successfully executed
